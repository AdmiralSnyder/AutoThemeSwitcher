# AutoThemeSwitcher
automatically switches between VS themes

put a .vstheme file in your solution, and write the name of the theme you want in there. 
then you can have a different theme for different brances.

The mechanism for theme switching is inspired by the Theme Switcher extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=frankschierle.ThemeSwitcher ( https://github.com/frankschierle/ThemeSwitcher )

TODO

[ ] solve the problem that switching the color theme takes ~ 5 seconds

[ ] hook on an event for changed Configurations (Debug, Release, ...) - this will need options, because speed.
