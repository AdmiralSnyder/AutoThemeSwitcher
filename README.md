# AutoThemeSwitcher
automatically switches between VS themes

put a .vstheme file in your solution, and write the name of the theme you want in there. 
then you can have a different theme for different branches.

The mechanism for theme switching is inspired by the Theme Switcher extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=frankschierle.ThemeSwitcher ( https://github.com/frankschierle/ThemeSwitcher )
